					Speech Recognition Technology can be embedded in various real time applications in order to increase the human-computer interaction. 
					From robotics to health care and aerospace, from interactive voice response systems to mobile telephony and telematics, speech recognition technology have enhanced the human-machine interaction. 
					Gender recognition is an important component for the application embedding speech recognition as it reduces the computational complexity for the further processing in these applications. Human speech has hierarchical structure to have meaningful information. 
					Speech is not a sequence of steady state sounds, abruptly changing from one to other. It consists of sentences, sentences can be divided in to words, words are constituted by phonemes which are the basic voice construction elements. 
	                                We use language every day without devoting much thought to the process. A study of acoustic characteristics of any language begins with the phonetic Analysis of that language. 
					Speech is one of the most information-laid signals, speech sounds have a rich and multi-layered temporal variation that convey emotions, words, intention, expressions, intonation, accent, speaker identity, gender, age, style of speaking, state of health of speaker. 
					The major concern in any language will be the identification, separation and processing of vowels and consonants of that language. 
					In our study for analysis we are using the pre-recorded samples of various subjects differing in age and gender .
					The analysis is carried out with respect to basic acoustic features and spectrogram, to extract formant frequency, pitch and intensity. We present a method that analyzes a two-dimensional magnitude
                                        spectrogram S(f, t) into its local constituent spectro-temporal amplitudes A(f, t), frequencies F(f, t), orientations Θ(f, t), andphases φ(f, t). The method operates by performing a twodimensional
                                        local Gabor-like analysis of the spectrogram, retainingonly the parameters of the 2D-Gabor filter with maximal amplitude
                                        response within the local region.

					<!-- Start edit here  -->
					In recent years, several studies investigated the use of the spectrogram (or spectrogram-like transformations) as a basis for
                                        extracting perceptual cues from speech . The application domains in which these studies were performed include speech
                                        intelligibility analysis , emotion recognition, and automatic speech recognition. The outcomes of these studies
                                        show that socially informative perceptual cues can be extracted from the spectro-temporal patterns in the spectrogram.

					<!-- Start edit here  -->
					The process of speech sequence segmenting comprises of the following steps:<br><br>
						  a. <b>Preprocessing:</b> Preprocessing of speech signals is considered a crucial step in the development of a robust and efficient speech 
						                   or speaker recognition system.STE based methods of speech signal segregation utilizes the fact  that  energy  in  the  voiced  region  is  greater  than  in  the  silence/unvoiced  region.  So,  a  small  window 
                                                                   is  taken  and  the  energy  of  the  window  calculated;  if  the  total  energy of the window is more than the chosen threshold, then samples  of  the  window  are  retrieved,  otherwise  dropped. 
						                   We  conducted  two  different  experiments;  first  one  with  a  non-overlapping  moving  window  of  fixed  size,  and  another  with  an overlapping moving window of fixed size. 
						                   The overlapping moving  window  technique  has  been  used  to  prevent  valuable  information loss. <br><br>
					          
					           b. <b>Spectrogram Plotting:</b> Spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of sound or other signal as they vary with time or some other variable.The temporal resolution of the spectrogram is defined by a single parameter  t, the length of the time segments or time resolution.
					                                    The spectrogram is created with a Hanning window and an overlap of  t/2.A common format is a graph with two geometric dimensions: one axis represents time or RPM,the other axis is frequency; a third dimension indicating the amplitude of a particular frequency at a particular 
					                                    time is represented by the intensity or color of each point in the image.Audio would usually be represented with a logarithmic amplitude axis (in decibels, or dB), and frequency would be linear to emphasize harmonic relationships.This process essentially corresponds to
					                                    computing the squared magnitude of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of the signal s(t) — that is, for a window width w    Spectrogram(t,w)=|STFT(t,w)|^2.<br><br>
					
					                                                                                       
					
                                                   c.  <b>Gabor Transform:</b>      In the log-Gabor method the spectrogram is generated by applying the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to the speech
                                                                             signal. The temporal resolution of the spectrogram is defined by a single parameter  t, the length of the time segments or time resolution.
					                                     The spectrogram is created with a Hanning window and an overlap of  t/2.
                                                                             The input for the log-Gabor transform is the logarithm of the spectrogram, as is common in, for instance, automatic speech
                                                                             recognition.The log Gabor transform has its basis in the Gabor function, which represents the optimal measurement of location,
                                                                             frequency and orientation. For the log-Gabor method, we employ logarithmic Gabor functions.A multiresolution filter bank of log Gabor filters provides equal
                                                                             coverage of the Fourier domain with minimal overlap between the filters. The log-Gabor method employs such a filter bank,yielding a filtered “energy image” of the spectrogram for each
                                                                             combination of the ns scales and no orientations. For each filteredimage, a specific scale and orientation is retained. Scales can be interpreted as the difference in pixel
					                                     period of patterns in the image (e.g. high and low pitch harmonics are spaced at a different pixel distance) and orientations can be vertical (e.g.harmonics), horizontal (e.g. rhythm), 
					                                     or oriented (e.g. attack and decay).
					                                                                           G(f, t) = A · W(f, t) · cos(2πF(ˆx + Φ)) (1)  where xˆ = tcosΘ + fsinΘ (2)
                                                                             and W(f, t) is a Gaussian-like window (to be defined later). For phase estimation, we will need the notion of a complex Gabor, which will consist of real and imaginary versions of equation 1 in quadrature phasee
					                                                                            G∗(f, t) = A · W(f, t) · ej(2πF (ˆx+Φ)

                                                                                                    <br><br>

					                                 among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor. 
					                                 The k-nearest neighbours (kNN) model was trained on a large numbers of voice samples to incorporate total variability in feature space. Hence, parameters of the model were set accordingly to classify speakers.
						                         This model was applied on a test data to cluster the 20ms time frames pertaining to individual speakers. For every 1 sec (50 time frames of 20ms each), the mode of the data was found and assigned to the whole 1 sec time frame. <br><br>

						The TSP speech contains over 1400 utterances spoken by 24 speakers (half male, half female). This report describes the TSP speech database.
